#summary Vector class
<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />
= Vector class =
`class POGEL::VECTOR` is an extention of `class POGEL::POINT`
== constructors: ==
`POGEL::VECTOR` has all the constructors from `POGEL::POINT`.
{{{
POGEL::VECTOR(POGEL::POINT p);
}}}
the vector will point from the origin `(0,0,0)` to point `p`.
{{{
POGEL::VECTOR(POGEL::POINT p1, POGEL::POINT p2);
}}}
the vector will point in the direction from `p1` to `p2`.

== attributes: ==
`POGEL::VECTOR` has all the same attributes as `POGEL::POINT`.

== methods: ==
{{{
void normalize();
}}}
modifies this vector to have a distance of 1.0.
{{{
POGEL::VECTOR normal();
}}}
retruns a vector with this vectors direction but with a length of 1.0. does not modify this vector.
{{{
void anglenormalize();
}}}
modifies the vector to have its x, y, and z values to be less than 180.0, but greater than -180.0.
{{{
POGEL::VECTOR anglenormal();
}}}
returns a copy of this vector that `anglenormalize()` was called for.
{{{
float getdistance();
}}}
retruns the lingth of the vector.
{{{
float getangle(POGEL::VECTOR,POGEL::VECTOR);
}}}
EXPIRAMENTAL: retruns the angle in degreess between this vector and another referencing a third vector.
{{{
POGEL::VECTOR& dodotproduct(POGEL::VECTOR v);
}}}
returns the perpindicular vector between this vector and `v`.
{{{
float dotproduct(POGEL::VECTOR v);
}}}
retruns how far this vector travels allong vector `v`.
{{{
void frompoints(POGEL::POINT a, POGEL::POINT b);
}}}
sets this vector to the direction from vector `a` to vector `b`.

== operators: ==
`POGEL::VECTOR` has all the same operators as `POGEL::POINT`.
