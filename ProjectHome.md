POGEL is a physics, and graphics engine all in one.

I created this to entertain myself, so expect no stable, nor mathematically accurate code nor correct algorithmic implementations.

This is completely arbitrary code, excluding the window creation files which are from nehe.gamedev.net, if anything else is used from somewhere else, it is usually referenced.

pogel does use code from http://code.google.com/p/arraylist/ though slightly modified.

If you wish to use any of the code inside of this project please link to here.

NOTE: it is pronounced poe-gell.
